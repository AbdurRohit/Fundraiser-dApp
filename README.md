# Decentralized Fundraiser ðŸ•Š Blockchain Application

This repository contains a decentralized blockchain application developed during the MLH hackathon. The application leverages the power of decentralized technologies to solve the centralization of fund currency.

## Technologies Used![Alt text](image.png)

- **React JS:** The frontend of the application is built using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Solidity:** Smart contracts, the backbone of decentralized applications, are written in Solidity. Solidity is a programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

- **Web3:** Web3.js is a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows seamless communication between the frontend and smart contracts.

- **Hedera Hashgraph (Hedera):** Hedera is used as the backend technology for this application. Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology that provides fast, secure, and fair transactions.

# Features

## Hashgraph Consensus Integration:

1. **Efficient and Secure Transactions:**
   - Leverage the power of the hashgraph consensus algorithm for efficient and secure transaction processing.

2. **High Transaction Throughput:**
   - Benefit from near-perfect efficiency in bandwidth usage, allowing the application to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

3. **Tamper-Proof Logging:**
   - Ensure tamper-proof and verifiable logging of transactions with the Hedera Consensus Service.

## Smart Contract Development with Solidity:

1. **Trust Layers for Decentralized Applications:**
   - Enable developers to build trust layers for decentralized applications using the Hedera Smart Contract service.

2. **Solidity Programming:**
   - Program in Solidity, a popular language for developing smart contracts.

3. **Optimized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):**
   - Leverage the Besu Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) optimized for the Hedera network, providing low and predictable fees, a carbon-negative footprint, and high performance.

## Token Management with Hedera Token Service:

1. **Configurable Token Management:**
   - Implement configurable, minting, and management of both fungible and non-fungible tokens on Hedera.

2. **High Throughput Token Transactions:**
   - Achieve high transaction throughput (10,000 transactions per second) with immediate settlement and low, fixed transaction costs.

3. **Fine-Grained Control:**
   - Offer fine-grained control over tokens and accounts, allowing for flexible configurations, including account KYC verification, freezing, and token supply management.
## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdurRohit/Fundraiser-dApp
   cd Fundraiser-dApp


### `npm install`
Install all the dependencies.

### `npm install`
Set up the .env file
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are located in the `contracts` directory. To deploy or interact with them, you can use tools like [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

## Hedera Integration

For detailed information on integrating with Hedera, please refer to the [Hedera documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/).
